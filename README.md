# CurrencyConverter-demoapp

For that test task I have used: MVVM, Swift, SwiftUI. 

Mostly for assigning values I prefer to use DI (Swinject, Typhoon, swift-dependencies). For SwiftUI in the last project I used "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies". But for the demo project I will create dependencies manually.
